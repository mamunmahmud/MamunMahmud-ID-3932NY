Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
Use of appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently,

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
B.
Insertion, Deletion.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
C.
Compiler Design,
Operating System,
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis,
Graphics,
Artificial Intelligence,
and Simulation.




what is an Array?
D.
An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type.


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?

E.
An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.

what is LinkedList?
F.
A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
G.
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. ... While a linked list is a
data structure which contains a sequence of the elements where each element is linked to its next element.


what is queue?
H.
Queue is an interface in java.

what is stack?
I.
A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
J.

FIFO= first in first out.
LIFO= last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
K.
This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two
factors of it. Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will
run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
L.
The term best-case performance is used in computer science to describe an algorithm's behavior under optimal conditions.
For example, the best case for a simple linear search on a list occurs when the desired element is the first element of the list.


what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
M.




what is tree in data structure?
N.
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node
is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"),
with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.


what is graph in data structure?
O.
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.



what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
P.

Performance : HashMap is much faster and uses less memory than Hashtable as former is unsynchronized . Unsynchronized
objects are often much better in performance in compare to synchronized object like Hashtable in single threaded environment.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Q.
RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
Network data model = Graph
Hierarchical data model = Trees


How HashMap works in java?
R.
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time.


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

S.
ava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access
array element with an illegal index. This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal
to the size of the array.


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
T.

How to Copy One Array to Another in Java
Manually. In this method we manually copy elements one by one. ...
Arrays.copyOf() We can directly copy one array to another by using Arrays.copyOf() method. ...
System.arraycopy() It is another method that directly copies one array to another. ...
Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?

U.
The major difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure. Arrays are index based data structure where
 each element associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the
 data and the references to the previous and next element.


What is DFS and BFS?

V.
The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing and searching a
node in a graph.

What is Recursion?
W.
Recursion is a common method of simplifying a problem into subproblems of same type.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
X.
Image result for What are linear and non linear data Structures?techdifferences.com
Examples of linear data structures are Arrays, Stack, Queue and Linked List. An arrays is a collection of data items having
 the same data types. ... All the data elements in non linear data structure can not be traversed in single run. Examples of
 non linear data structures are Trees and Graphs.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Y.

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Z.
	  Best	Average	Worst
Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Bubble Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Heap Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n)))
Bucket Sort	Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)



Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
